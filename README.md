# HangMan
A project that I had a lot of fun doing.

The whole project uses Python with the PySide6 Library.

One day, we were asked to create the basis of a HangMan Game that you could play in the console
The next day, they asked us to learn how to use tkinter and create a user interface.

The third day they asked us to combine acquired skills to create a full hangman game with a usable interface.
Since we were free to use any UI Library we want, I choose another library that I was more used to and created the game.

I didn't really used any preset components like buttons, but hard coded them piece by piece.
I am currently working on other projects, while experimenting on ways to better exploit the capabilities of OOP.
